# Snap-Workshop
Workshop for middle schoolers to learn the basics of Snap! Snap! is a visual, drag-and-drop programming language like Scratch.

## Get Started

1.  Go to the Snap! webpage [https://cloud.snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html](https://cloud.snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html)
    
2.  Create an account using their email
    
 **Uses:** Snap! is mainly used for creating interactive animations and games as an introduction to computer programming suitable for people of all ages.

**Purpose:** The main objective of this workshop is to give students a basic understanding of block programming so that they can use Snap! to create their own projects.

**Goal:** Create two projects to teach students how to use event listeners and variables in their own games and how to make a click alonzo game and pinwheel graphics in Snap!

## Challenges:

1.  Create a game that makes the sprite disappear when it is clicked [ClickAlonzo](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/2-start-your-first-snap-app.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment)
    
2.  Figuring out the correct turning angles to draw [pinwheels](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/3-blocks-with-inputs.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment), etc.
